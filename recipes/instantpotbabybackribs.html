                <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 rack baby back pork ribs</li>
                <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
                <li>1/4 cup barbeque sauce, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine kosher salt, brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl for the spice rub.</li>
                <li>Cut the rack of ribs into 4 equal portions. Rub all sides of each piece with spice rub./li>
                <li>Pour broth into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant PotÂ®). Add ribs in a teepee formation. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 30 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove lid. Move ribs to the baking sheet using tongs. Brush ribs on all sides with barbeque sauce.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Turn ribs and continue baking until meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 7 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
